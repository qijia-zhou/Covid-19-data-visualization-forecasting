# Covid 19 Data Visualization Forecasting
### This project includes exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and time-series forecasting for the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The data was collected from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), and covers the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries for each country up to July 2023, with a total of over 17,000 data records.

The visualization component of this project includes comparisons of the COVID-19 outbreak in different countries, as well as an animated scatter plot to show the worldwide spread of cases. The forecasting component uses various time-series forecasting techniques, including the naive approach, moving average model, Holt linear, exponential smoothing, and ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models.
